# Excel-manipulation_python
Extracting data from excel sheets and creating sheets with required data

 Project Idea :- </br>
The core idea of this project is to use student timetable data as input and automat
ically generate <br>

 • Faculty timetables, showing their teaching schedules for different courses.<br>
 • Classroom schedules, specifying the time slots for each room and the classes
 assigned to them.<br>
 • Lab schedules, specifying the time slots for each Lab and batch
 assigned to them.<br>
 
 This involves organizing the provided data into a format suitable for processing and
 then systematically populating the timetables for both faculty and classrooms. The
 focus is on efficient data handling and accurate timetable generation rather than
 conflict resolution or optimization.
